        <h2>About SEO</h2>
        <center>
            <p>Search engine optimization (SEO) is the process of improving the quality and quantity of website traffic  to a website or a web page from search engines. SEO targets unpaid traffic <br> (known as "natural" or "organic" results) rather than direct traffic or paid traffic. Unpaid traffic may originate from different kinds of searches,<br> including image search, video search, academic search, news search, and industry-specific vertical search engines.
                <br><br><br><hr>
                As an Internet marketing strategy, SEO considers how search engines work, the computer-programmed algorithms that dictate search engine behavior, what people search for, <br>the actual search terms or keywords typed into search engines, and which search engines are preferred by their targeted audience. SEO is performed because a website will receive more visitors from a <br>search engine when websites rank higher on the search engine results page (SERP). These visitors can then potentially be converted into customers.
